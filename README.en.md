title: You are here because I was not sensitive to your recruitment approach

I don't mean to blame you, I don't mean to humiliate you or even laugh at you.
You are here because I was not sensitive to your recruitment approach and that I believe you can get better. If you agree with that, let's have a look at some common mistakes.

# Common mistakes

## You sent me a non-personalized message

> Hi!
>
> Would you be interested in a new job opportunity?
> If so, please send me a resume!

Is this type of message familiar to you? If that's what you used to
contact me, it is sadly generic:

* it says nothing about the company you are recruiting for;
* it says nothing about the reason you would recruit me (why me?).

If your message starts by

> Hello ${FIRSTNAME}

you can easily guess that it is not a good start.

## I am not the person you are looking for

Did you check my current position?

If you are offering a job that has no relation with what I currently do
or what I am looking for, there are very few chances I could be interested
in it.

## I am not the person you are writing to

What makes you message specific to me and not to somebody else?

If you cannot answer that question, what could make me feel concerned
about it?

## I don't swap

Did you ask me to forward your offer to my network or to refer you
people from my network?

If you did, maybe I am not so unique as you wrote a few lines above.
Or maybe you don't really want to hire _me_, you just want to hire
whoever it is.

## It is the third time you send me the _exact same_ message

Unlike me, LinkedIn and my mailbox have a very good memory. When
you write me a message, I can see the _same_, the _exact same_ message
that you wrote a few weeks ago. What makes you think I would answer
you this time?

# Oh, one more thing

## Word-format resume

When you contact me on LinkedIn, why would you ask me for a resume?
What additional information do you expect to find? If something is missing,
why not asking me directly?

More specifically, why would you ask me for a _Word_ resume? This format
has the unpleasant particularity to me editable. Why, oh why would you
make changes to my resume?

## That nice Sunday night e-mail

You're right: I might be more receptive to your e-mail, comfortably chilling
on my sofa, on a Sunday night. At least, you can expect me to be less
sollicited and more available. And I may even read it! But what is the
Dark Side of this e-mail?

This e-mail (even if automatically sent) suggests that _you_ are working
on a Sunday night. I may interpret easily that is a common practice in
this comopany.

I hope that you don't advertize a great work/life balance in it!
